# Keybindings
When working with a physical keyboard, you can use key bindings for performing various text actions.

The editor provides support for some key bindings by default. The currently supported key bindings are mostly similar to Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA.
## Built-in Keybindings
The following key bindings are currently supported by the editor :

| Keybinding             | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl + A`             | Select all.                                                                                                                                |
| `Ctrl + X`             | If no content is selected, cuts the current line. Otherwise, performs the usual cut operation.                                             |
| `Ctrl + C`             | If no content is selected, selects and copies the current line. Otherwise, performs the usual copy operation.                              |
| `Ctrl + V`             | The usual paste action.                                                                                                                    |

## Custom Keybindings
You can subscribe
to [`KeyBindingEvent`](https://github.com/Rosemoe/sora-editor/blob/main/editor/src/main/java/io/github/rosemoe/sora/event/KeyBindingEvent.java)
and add your own key bindings. You can even override the default key bindings and perform actions of
your own.
